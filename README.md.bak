# randomWinApp
Random Windows App using Win32 api (windows.h) and C++ (in Dev C++, no fancy stuff)

## Description
This is just playing really. I wanted to go back to fundamentals of Windows programming and the event loop. I feel it's good to do this and have a sound foundation of 
what is going on before getting deep into any of the major frameworks.

The application now has a purpose. It takes an inputted height in centimetres and allows user to select from 'whitewater' and 'touring' style of paddling. The user then presses a button and will get a result in centimetres for the correct paddle length based on standard sizes.
