# randomWinApp
Random Windows App using Win32 api (windows.h) and C++ (in Dev C++, no fancy stuff)

## Description
This is just playing really. I wanted to go back to fundamentals of Windows programming and the event loop. I feel it's good to do this and have a sound foundation of 
what is going on before getting deep into any particular framework.
